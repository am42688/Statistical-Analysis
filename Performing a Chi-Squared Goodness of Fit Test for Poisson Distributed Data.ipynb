    "In this problem we will explore whether discoveries of successful oil wells in a basin occurs randomly. The basin in question is the Eastern Shelf area of the Permian Basin in Fisher and Noland counties in Texas. The basin has been subdivivded into 160 tracts (each tract has an area of approximately 10miles2, though this figure will not be used in this problem). A total of 168 successful wells have been drilled in the 160 tracts. The number of successful wells per tract is shown in the following table:\n",
